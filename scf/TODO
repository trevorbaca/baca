TODO

1. Extend studio to accpet 'Sekka' in addition to 'sekka'

2. Change named pair handling from 'add: add performer' to just 'add performer'.

3. Take another stab at (short) instrument name markup handling. Automatically capitalize intelligently.

4. List percussionist instruments correctly.

5. Dialog with user when user selects untuned percussion. Request instrument name.
