TODO

1. Write range handling tests.

2. Change named pair handling from 'add: add performer' to just 'add performer'.

3. Remove default prompt when default handling. Detect empty return and accept as default indicator.

4. Implement 'del 5'.

5. List percussionist instruments correctly.

6. Dialog with user when user selects untuned percussion. Request instrument name.

7. Take another stab at (short) instrument name markup handling. Automatically capitalize intelligently.

8. Extend studio to accpet 'Sekka' in addition to 'sekka'
