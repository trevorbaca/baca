TODO

0. Debug choice of clarinet in E-flat.

1. Implement score next, prev & backtracking.

2. Implement 'all' object of deletion.

3. Change named pair handling from 'add: add performer' to just 'add performer'.

(6. Implement menu range-handling selection. So 1-2 for both items 1 and 2. Also 1,3-4 and so on.)

7. List percussionist instruments correctly.

8. Dialog with user when user selects untuned percussion. Request instrument name.
