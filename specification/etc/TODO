1. refactor interpret() n * O(n) traversal to O(n) with first-pass sort.

2. implement RetrievalRequest as base class for different retrieval requests classes.

3. extend ContextProxy to store *resolved* settings only ... only this won't do for the payload context proxies;
   so maybe subclass ContextProxy to ResolvedSettingContextProxy?
