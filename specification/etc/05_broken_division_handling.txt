(1) How are broken divisions to be handled?

(2) Maybe the first thing to notice is that broken divisions are a type of byproduct
arising during interpretation. Composers specify only complete divisions. But differences
between the pattern of divisions within a segment and the duration of the segment
may give rise to broken divisions.

(3) It is the voices within any given segment that may be the bearers of broken divisions
because it is the voices within any given segment that bear divisions, no matter what their type.

(4) Divisions may be left-broken, or right-broken, or both left- and right-broken,
or neither left- nor right-broken.

(5) We can say that one of the things that happens during interpretation is broken duration discovery.

(6) Consider division d. In the case that d is right-broken but not left-broken, 
the duration of d equals the sum m + n, with m and n equal to the 'segment duration' 
of d and the 'right overhang duration' of d, respectively.
In the case the d is left-broken but not right-broken, the duration of d 

(7) Discovery is unproblematic: calculate the divisions for whatever voice is current under iteration,
notice whether the rightmost division is right-broken, and note the fact somewhere in the context tree
if the voice contains a right-broken division.
