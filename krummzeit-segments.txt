[E: 3-5-7-1] myrkr (3). glissando thicket (5). pf+x points (7). pf clusters
(1). pf+x points connect to pf clusters by register. pf+x points connect to pf
clusters by rhythm. pf+x points and pf clusters hybridize by alternation.
alternation of subsections. alternation of divisions. what is the register of
pf+x points? what is the register of pf clusters? pf+x points occur in the
section before last ([C]) and again in the next section ([F]). pf+x points
range falls from [C] to [E] to [F]. pf+x points in 7th octave in [C]. pf+x
points in 6th octave octave in [E]. pf+x points in 4th octave in [F]. pf+x
points still quite high in [E]. piccolo woodblock available together with pf+x
points. lh-muted pf with piccolo woodblock xylophone. alternation from lh-muted
pf+x to pf clusters is possible with rh playing clusters and pianist standing.
glissando thicket (5) precedes pf+x points (7). bleedover from 5.1 "ob+cl
inflected chromatic line" into pf+x points (7.1). oboe and Bb clarinet or Eb
clarinet play in frayed unison ascent with color variation and mircotonal
respelling. the ascent is fragmented to occur a couple of divisions at a time
throughout [E] with rested divisions appearing between occurrences.
